  # cat=basic/enable; type=options[0,1,2]; label=Debug Mode: Display debug information about every Flux template being rendered and every ConfigurationProvider being used. Value "0" (production) means debug messages are disabled and Exceptions may be suppressed. Value "1" (development) means every debug message is displayed. Value "2" (staging, testing) means only severe errors' messages are dislayed.

  # cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Sheet compacting: If enabled, compacts Flux FlexForms which only have a single sheet into a ROOT-type form instead. If your site contains current elements do not enable this - however, the option is safe to enable for new sites.

  # cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Development stage rewriting of LLL files: If enabled, Flux will aggressively read, change and save LLL files whenever automatic LLL labels are built, if that label is missing from the LLL file. Beware! This will add significant processing time and I/O - enable this only while you are in translation mode or need your LLL files to be updated by Flux instead of doing it manually. Can be used as a migration tool: taking a backup of a collection of templates, removing all labels from fields, forms, sections etc. and then enabling this feature and clearing all caches, will add every missing LLL label to the LLL file in question. Note: requires an existing, valid LLL file and supports only the old style locallang.xml files - also sorts existing labels! Having tidy installed is pretty much mandatory.
