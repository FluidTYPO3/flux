  # cat=basic/enable; type=options[0,1,2]; label=Debug Mode: Display debug information about every Flux template being rendered and every ConfigurationProvider being used. Value "0" (production) means debug messages are disabled and Exceptions may be suppressed. Value "1" (development) means every debug message is displayed. Value "2" (staging, testing) means only severe errors' messages are dislayed.

  # cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Disable Fluid caching of Flux forms: If enabled, this option forces Fluid to re-parse the template file sources on every access - which can be a benefit in a development context, requiring the caches to be cleared less frequently - but with the drawback of slightly decreasing performance in both FE and BE. Note: This option can also help prevent PHP fatal errors on Flux templates which for whichever reason fail to compile but do not report an error in the process.

  # cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Sheet compacting: If enabled, compacts Flux FlexForms which only have a single sheet into a ROOT-type form instead. If your site contains current elements do not enable this - however, the option is safe to enable for new sites.

  # cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Error handling: If enabled, all Flux controllers are permitted to handle their own errors in ways that are far more flexible than traditional error catching. Enable with care - if your plugin, content or page template collection does not contain an Error.html template, your site may risk breaking with an extremely basic and not very informative error á la "Template not found for action foobar" but when enabled and combined with proper error templates you can customise pretty much any error which might happen anywhere when a Flux controller subclass is in play. Best turned off on development sites unless you are developing exactly error templates as it greatly limits debug output!
