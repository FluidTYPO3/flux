Flux automates integration of Fluid with TYPO3 and makes Fluid the entry point for developers. The name "Flux" has
multiple meanings but in this context, it mainly refers to the gel-like fluid used when soldering components together
in electronic hardware, making it easier to create a bond between components and improves the durability of the bond.
