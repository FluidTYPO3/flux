## Release: 7.2.2 (2015/09/20)

Solid round of bug fixes mainly, few added minor (and fully backwards compatible) features and focus on fixes for drag-and-drop
and copy-paste behavior on TYPO3 6.2. Some minor fixes for workspaces support.

Notable changes/features:

1. Template paths now use `0` as default index instead of previous `10`. This *can* have an adverse effect on sites that for some
   reason has one or more sets of templates which: **a)** are configured by replacing the default `10` index, AND, **b)** have
   removed one or more templates that exist in the original path. Such a setup *may begin to display previously disabled template
   files as selectable options in the backend*. To fix this, update your TypoScript template paths to use `0` as the bottom
   priority paths.
2. Icons now support SVG files. Not much to say about this one - use an `.svg` file as icon for a template, either through the
   `icon` Form option or by placing it in the convention-based expected icon path.
3. Form now supports `sorting` as a global option that can be used by any implementation; previously `fluidcontent` added its own
   but can now delegate this to Flux. This means that from now on you should define `options="{sorting: 10}"` instead of wrapping
   the sorting value in a scope like `{Fluidcontent: {sorting: 10}}`.
4. When rendering Requests and when retrieving Form instances from templates, Flux will now respect the `vendorName` request
   parameter - and will in fact pass-through the original Request (as a cloned instance) whenever an original Request exists.
   Though this change doesn't have any effect on the surface, it does improve frontend rendering scope consistency when rendering
   through a custom Flux controller.
5. TYPO3 7.4 is now supported.
