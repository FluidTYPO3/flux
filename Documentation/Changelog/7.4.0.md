## Release: 7.4.0 (2015/05/16)

Minor release with a couple new features:
 
- The Flux Package API which allows a simple class to be implemented and control how Flux is integrated (which controllers your
  provider extension supports, the default template paths it uses, and more). See https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/flux/pull/1038.
- Flux form `options` can now be defined as dotted paths, for example `<flux:form.option name="FluidContent.sorting" value="100" />`.
  See https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/flux/pull/1042.
- Flux provider extensions can now be registered for any feature with a single command - filename conventions and detection then
  determine which features get enabled. See https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/flux/commit/1e379247567c0f94921de0f82be9dc5a638f5091.

And a very important bug fix:

- Bugfix for editing IRRE relations in a FlexForm, applying to both new and existing elements (workaround for TYPO3 issue below)
  - https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/flux/commit/6508a5fb26af1511ab5d6309d7e6ffffcc222f1d
