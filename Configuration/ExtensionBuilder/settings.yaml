###########    Overwrite settings  ###########
#
# These settings only apply, if the roundtrip feature of the extension builder
# is enabled in the extension manager
#
# Usage:
# nesting reflects the file structure
# a setting applies to a file or recursive to all files and subfolders
#
# merge:
# means for classes: All properties ,methods and method bodies
# of the existing class will be modified according to the new settings
# but not overwritten
#
# for locallang xml files: Existing keys and labels are always
# preserved (renaming in the GUI has only influence on the property and method names)
#
# for other files: You will find a Split token at the end of the file
# After this token you can write whatever you want and it will be appended
# everytime the code is generated
#
# keep:
# files are never overwritten
# These settings may break the functionality of the extension builder!
# Handle with care!

######### settings for classBuilder #############################
#
# here you may define default parent classes for your classes
# these settings only apply for new generated classes
# you may also just change the parent class in the generated class file.
# It will be kept on next code generation, if the overwrite settings
# are configured to merge it
