            // static TS.
            // The only currently known edge case that causes this infinite recursion is when a frontend request is made
            // to a non-existing page that is recorded in the "redirects" module as a redirect. When the redirect has
            // been processed, the request to the target page is not affected by the potential infinite recursion. This
            // means that the negative side effect is only ever relevant at a point where no content rendering can take
            // place - and therefore, the negative impact of this is considered very marginal.
