Translations and Contribution Info
==================================

The translations shipped with this extension are provided as-is, with no guarantee for correctness. Non-English
translations will not be maintained _except through user contributions_.

**Please do not open GitHub issues asking for translations to be corrected! If you wish a translation to be changed
or added, open a pull request.**

And do not request integration with Crowdin. That will not happen.

Contributions
-------------

You may contribute translations as pull request to add/change XLF files in the repository. But please observe these
couple of basic rules:

* Only submit translations if you are a native speaker of the language you are translating to.
* Do not submit any AI or AI-assisted translations. You - a human - must know and understand the context of labels.
* All translations must be in XLF format.
